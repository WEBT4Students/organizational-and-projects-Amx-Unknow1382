    <h2>Word Wide Web General</h2>
    <p>1. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), URL (Uniform Resource Locator), HTML, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol).</p>
    <p>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</p>
    <p>3. A URL consists of five parts: the scheme, subdomain, top-level domain, second-level domain, and subdirectory.</p>
    <br> <br>

    <h2>Webserver</h2>
    <p>1. A web server is software and hardware that uses <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP </a> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.</p>
    <p>2. You are very likely reading this via a web browser right now. Web browsers are applications that are meant to surf the web FireFox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and safari are all web browsers. The web browser itself has some access to your machine, whether that be a cell phone, or a desktop, and it also has some protocols for talking to web-servers.</p>
    <p>3. Content stored on a server is divided into packets for transmission, and is sent through special computers called routers that determine the best path for that data to travel -- through a series of wired and wireless networks -- to reach an Internet service provider and ultimately a computer.</p>
    <p>4. Web content refers to the textual, aural, or visual content published on a website. Content means any creative element, for example, text, applications, images, archived e-mail messages, data, e-services, audio and video files, and so on.</p>
    <br> <br>

    <h2>Webclient</h2>
    <p>1.) Client software is a specific application that’s installed on your computer, that can be used to communicate to some other piece of software over a network (such as the internet’s world wide web). However, a client software doesn't necessarily need a network connection to run on your computer.</p>
    <p>2.) A Web client typically refers to the Web browser in the user's machine or mobile device. It may also refer to extensions and helper applications that enhance the browser to support special services from the site. Contrast with Web server. See browser extension.</p>
    <p>No, they aren't</p>
    <br> <br>

    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>1. The <em>*head*</em> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <*html*> tag and the <*body*> tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.</p>
    <p>2. <em>*!DOCTYPE html*</em>is the doctype for the document. It basically tells the web browser how to render the page (there are different doctypes). If the page renders improperly with a correct doctype, that means that the page wasn't correctly coded.</p>
    <p>3. It has a start tag <em>*html*</em> and an end tag <em>*/html*</em>. The <em>*body*</em>element defines the document's body. It has a start tag <em>*body*</em>and an end tag <em>*/body*</em>.</p>
    <p>4. You can write your text in <em>*body*</em> with h1, h2, ... . These are the size of the written text. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-emphasize-text-in-a-document-using-html5/">Examples and Explaintion</a>
    <h1>h1</h1>         <h2>h2</h2>         <h3>h3</h3>         <h4>h4</h4>         <h5>h5</h5></p>
    <p>5. Normal Written Text <br>
        *sup* Defines superscripted <sup>Text</sup> <br>
        *sub* Defines subscripted <sub> Text <br>
        *ins* Defines inserted <ins> Text <br>
        *del*> Defines deleted <del>Text</del> <br>
        *mark* Defines marked/highlighted <mark>Text</mark> <br>
        *strong* Defines important <strong>Text</strong> <br>
        *b* Defines bold <b>Text</b> <br>
        *em* Defines emphasized <em>Text</em> <br> 
        *i* Defines a part of <i>Text</i> in an alternate voice or mood <br>
